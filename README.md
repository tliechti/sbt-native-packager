This is a work in progress project.  The goal is to be able to bundle up Scala software built with SBT for native packaging systems, like deb, rpm, homebrew, msi.

# Announcement - 1.0.0 will require Java 7 or higher

The next release will require java 7 or higher. If you need java 6, please
join the discussion in [#498](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager/issues/498).

## Issues/Discussions

*  **Discussion/Questions**:
  If you wish to ask questions about the native packager, we have a [mailinglist](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sbt-native-packager) and
  we're very active on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sbt). You can either use the `sbt` tag or the
  `sbt-native-packager` tag.  They also have far better search support for working around issues.
* **Docs**:
  [Our docs are available online](http://scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager).  If you'd like to help improve the docs, they're part of this
  repository in the `src/sphinx` directory. [ScalaDocs](http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/latest/api/#package) are also available.
* **Issues/Feature Requests**:
  Finally, any bugs or features you find you need, please report to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager/issues/new).
  Please check the [compatibility matrix](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager/wiki/Tested-On) to see if your system is able to
  produce the packages you want.
  
## Features

* Build native packages for different systems
  * Universal `zip`,`tar.gz`, `xz` archives
  * `deb` and `rpm` packages for Debian/RHEL based systems
  * `dmg` for OSX
  * `msi` for Windows
  * `docker` images
* Provide archetypes for common use cases
 * Java application with startscripts for linux/osx/windows
 * Java server additional autostart configurations

## Installation

Add the following to your `project/plugins.sbt` file:

```scala
// for autoplugins
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-native-packager" % "1.0.3")
```

In your `build.sbt` enable the plugin you want. For example the
`JavaAppPackaging`.

```scala
enablePlugins(JavaAppPackaging)
```


For non-autoplugins use the `0.8.0` version.

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-native-packager" % "0.8.0")
```


For the native packager keys add this to your `build.sbt` if you use the a version
before `1.0.0`

```scala
import NativePackagerKeys._
```


## Experimental systemd bootsystem support ##

Native packager now provides experimental `systemd` startup scripts.
Currently it works on Fedora `Fedora release 20 (Heisenbug)` and doesn't work on Ubuntu because of partial `systemd` support in `Ubuntu 14.04 LTS`.
To enable this feature follow [My First Packaged Server Project guide](http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/GettingStartedServers/MyFirstProject.html) and use `Systemd` as server loader:

    import com.typesafe.sbt.packager.archetypes.ServerLoader.Systemd
    serverLoading in Rpm := Systemd

Any help on testing and improving this feature is appreciated so feel free to report bugs or making PR.


## Experimental Native Packages via `javapackager`

JDK 8 from Oracle includes the tool `javapackager` (n√©e `javafxpackager`) to generate application
launchers and native installers for MacOS X, Windows, and Linux. This plugin complements the existing
`sbt-native-packager` formats by taking the settings and staged output from `JavaAppPackaging`
and passing them through `javapackager`.

This plugin's most significant complement to the core `sbt-native-packager` capabilities is the
generation of MacOS X App bundles, and associated `.dmg` and `.pkg` package formats.
It can also generate Windows `.exe` and `.msi` installers provided the requisite tools are
available on the Windows build platform.

For usage details see the [JDKPackager Plugin guide](http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/formats/jdkpackager.html).
